I remember my first calculus class in high school.  It didn't go so well.  I decided I didn't like math.  However, that decision didn't stick.  I began college studying business hoping to avoid rigorous mathematics, physics or chemistry.  Over time, I found that topics that had once seemed insurmountable, now seemed conquerable.  I listened to podcasts which discussed physics, mathematics along with other technical and scientific disciplines.  My perspective changed and my curiosity was piqued.  How deeply could I learn of mathematics, what were my academic limits?  I began studying electrical engineering in 2013 at the University of Utah.  I fell in love with my first computer science class, though I found it very rigorous and challenging.  I fell in love with mathematics both applied to engineering and for its own sake.  I began to appreciate that we truly do stand on the shoulders of giants and how much research in science and technology has done for the world and our modern way of life.  Nearly every electrical engineering and computer science subject I studied opened up new worlds to me and gave me insight and appreciation for phenomenon that surrounds me everyday, some unremarkable others yielding greatly more gratification upon understanding the underlying principles.  I wish my life had room for knowledge of every discipline.  I'm in love with the transformation and excitement that comes with learning.

My first high school calculus class didn't go so well.  I decided at that point that mathematics wasn't for me, it wasn't fun and I was going to avoid it.  I decided I would study business and avoid more rigorous scientific or engineeing studies.  However, somehow that decision didn't stick. I am very grateful that I didn't let that decision remain permanent.  With age and a little more discipline, I found many endeavors that once seemed insurmountable, to be conquerable.  I began studying electrical engineering in 2014.  I fell in love with my first computer science class, though I found it very rigorous and challenging.
